# Task A. Case Study 1: Wilde’s Bramble food company

## Subtask 1. Iceberg Tool

### Events
- Wilde’s Bramble started as a small organic food business selling at local markets.
- An increase in customer demand led to partnerships with local shops and restaurants.
- To scale business, Alder and Calla Wilde leased additional farmland to increase production.
- Financial stress increased as they relied on credit cards and eventually took a mortgage. Calla also seek additional employment to manage cash flow.

### Patterns
- **Positive Pattern:** Initially, customer demand and sales increased significantly.
- **Negative Pattern:** Financial burdens escalated due to reliance on credit cards and loans, creating a cycle of short-term relief but long-term financial problems.
- **Cycle:** Temporary financial solutions, such as loans, lead to debt crises over time.

### Underlying Structure
- Over-reliance on external financing (credit cards, loans) to support business growth.
- Lack of financial planning for business scaling.
- Physical and financial capacity limits for further expansion.

### Mental Models
- Assumption that expanding production is the proper way to scale the business.
- Assumption that short-term financial measures will lead to long-term stability.

## Subtask 2. Behavior Over Time Graph

### Selected Graph: Graph 3
The third graph best represents the dynamics of Wilde’s Bramble farm. It shows:
1. **Initial Growth:** A startling increase in sales and production due to rising customer demand.
2. **Debt Accumulation:** A rise in financial obligations as external funding sources were used to scale operations.
3. **Decline in Financial Stability:** A drop of business profit when debt repayment started pressure on cash flow.

This graph reflects the relationship between increasing sales, growing financial obligations, and declining financial stability over time.

## Subtask 3. Combined Analysis

### Problem Analysis
The Iceberg Tool and the Behavior Over Time Graph reveal that:
- The **events** (increased demand) triggered **patterns** (growth followed by financial strain), which stemmed from **structures** (dependency on external financing and inadequate long-term planning).
- The **mental models** driving decision-making reinforced the cycle of short-term fixes leading to long-term debt accumulation.

### Key Insights
- Growth without financial planning leads to systemic instability.
- Addressing root causes, such as dependency on credit and lack of planning, is essential to breaking negative patterns.

### Conclusion
The Iceberg Tool and Behavior Over Time Graph highlight the related nature of Wilde’s Bramble’s challenges. To ensure stability, the business must focus on a proper growth plan.
